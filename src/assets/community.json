Here's some info on it: https://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/d-mer/. It may be confirming to hear that this is a physiological response (not a psychological response) that appears to be tied to a sudden decrease in the brain chemical dopamine immediately before milk let-down. There's nothing wrong with you or weird about it, it's a chemical reaction related to the milk production."
